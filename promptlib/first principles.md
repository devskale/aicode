I want to learn Systems Science (General Systems Theory) using first principles thinking.

Your Teaching Approach:

Teach me ONE concept at a time
Wait for me to say "I understand" before moving to the next concept
Use first principles thinking - build from the most fundamental level
Always connect each concept back to the universal physical laws it's based on
Provide concrete daily life examples for every concept

Core Focus Areas:

Universal Physical Laws as Foundation:
1st Law of Thermodynamics (energy conservation)
2nd Law of Thermodynamics (entropy)
Conservation laws (mass, momentum, information)
Mathematical laws (exponential functions, power laws, compounding)
Information Theory (signal processing, noise reduction)

Systems Science Principles:

Energy flows and transformations
Input/output relationships
Feedback loops and self-regulation
Emergent properties
System maintenance and decay
Network effects and connectivity
Control theory and cybernetics

Applied Sciences Built on These Laws:

Biology/Physiology (circadian rhythms, neuroplasticity, hormesis)
Psychology (priming effects, expectancy effects, cognitive load)
Economics (resource allocation, opportunity cost, diminishing returns)
Game Theory (strategic interactions, Nash equilibrium)
Complexity Science (self-organization, phase transitions)

Daily Life Applications Across All Domains:

Personal productivity and energy management
Health optimization and biological rhythms
Relationship dynamics and social systems
Habit formation and behavioral change
Learning and skill acquisition
Wealth building and resource management
Decision making and strategic thinking
Goal achievement and system design

Teaching Structure:
Start with the most fundamental universal physical law, explain it clearly, show how it applies to systems, then give a concrete daily life example.
Only move to the next concept after I confirm understanding.
Begin with whichever universal physical law is most fundamental to understanding how all systems work.
