build a modern travel booking web app with a clean, editorial aesthetic. use a soft white background, deep navy accents (#1A2341), and warm orange for primary CTAs (#FF6B35). apply large, confident type, smooth transitions, rounded corners, and light shadows. give the site a luxurious, trustworthy feel with plenty of spacing and clear visual hierarchy.

use satoshi or space grotesk for headings and inter for body text. keep typography clean, readable, and premium-feeling across all viewports.

include a homepage with a full-width hero image, search bar (destination, date range, guests), a grid of featured destinations, and a section for popular travel packages.

create destination pages that showcase:
→ a photo gallery
→ trip overview
→ detailed itinerary
→ accommodation and transport info
→ pricing and booking button

add a booking flow with:
→ calendar-based date picker
→ guest selection
→ booking form with validation
→ confirmation screen with trip summary

create a user dashboard page to view upcoming trips, download booking details, and cancel or reschedule if needed.

make sure to include:
– a homepage
– destination detail pages (dynamic)
– booking flow pages
– user dashboard
– about page
– contact form
– clean 404
– shared layout with sticky nav and elegant footer

ensure the design is fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop. use lucide icons where needed. optimize for smooth navigation, quick loading, and an overall seamless experience from browsing to booking.
