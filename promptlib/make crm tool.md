Prompt:
Create a clean, modern user interface for a web-based client CRM system — an all-in-one business management tool built for freelancers and small teams to handle projects, proposals, invoicing, and client management. The design should be inspired by Notion’s aesthetic: modular, calm, and ultra-minimal. Use a soft, harmonious color palette featuring light green, pastel blue, and muted orange accents. The interface should include a minimal left sidebar with simple icons for navigation (Dashboard, Analytics, Settings), and a spacious main content area that uses Notion-style blocks, toggle sections, and modular cards to display tasks, invoices, timelines, and client profiles.

Visualize elegant data charts like pie charts, bar graphs, and line graphs, all styled with soft shadows, rounded corners, and subtle gradients. Typography should use Inter or SF Pro, with bold titles (24–32px), clean labels, and fine secondary text. The background should be neutral (#F9FAFB), with dark readable text (#1A1A1A), generous padding, and consistent vertical rhythm. Every element should feel deliberate and easy to interact with — large touch targets, soft dividers, and a layout that balances clarity with functionality. The final UI should feel like a blend of Notion and Apple design — professional, polished, and calming.
