# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Name: Pomodoro 2.0 Full-Stack Application Development

---

### Overview

**Goal:**  
Develop a next-generation Pomodoro 2.0 web application that offers enhanced flexibility, customization, and deep-focus support. The solution will feature an engaging UI with advanced animations and 3D elements, optional AI-driven insights, and seamless integrations with calendars and a freemium monetization model via Stripe. The development process will leverage coding agents and model context protocols for efficiency and consistency, but these will not be part of the final runtime application.

**Target Users:**

- Students, professionals, and knowledge workers seeking advanced productivity tools.
- Users interested in deeper focus sessions, rich analytics, visual appeal, and a flexible subscription model.

**Core Value Proposition:**

- Highly customizable focus/break intervals beyond standard Pomodoro times.
- Visually engaging UI with animations, 3D effects, and responsive design.
- AI-driven insights and analytics for users who opt into higher-tier subscriptions.
- Freemium model with Stripe integration to sustainably monetize the platform.
