Design a fully custom, multi-page premium eCommerce website UI for a high-end, editorial-style brand that blends modern minimalism with a luxury shopping experience.

The layout should feel like a digital fashion magazine — bold, immersive, and visually curated — rather than a typical Shopify store. Use a unique color palette including Bone White (#F8F5F0) for the background, Obsidian Black (#111111) for typography, Vintage Rose (#B07D8D) as a soft accent, Brass Gold (#CDAA7D) for hover effects, and Smoked Graphite (#3A3A3A) for UI details. The homepage should feature a fullscreen cinematic hero, floating sticky cart and nav elements, a parallax-scrolling product spotlight, and curated lifestyle content blocks. The Shop/Collection page should have a masonry-style product grid with staggered layout, filter sidebar on desktop and a collapsible drawer on mobile, plus hover-reveal interactions. The Product Detail Page should use a split-screen layout with high-resolution visuals on the left and product info on the right, with expandable sections, sticky CTAs, and “complete the look” carousels. The Cart and Checkout pages should be clean, elegant, and functional — featuring a two-column layout with real-time updates, trust badges, and a smooth, step-by-step purchase flow. Include account pages for login, registration, orders, and profile management with minimalist dashboards. Also design immersive About/Story pages with scrolling timelines and founder notes, a Contact/Support page with accordion FAQs and branded forms, and optional pages like a Wishlist, Blog/Journal with shoppable editorial content, and a Build-Your-Kit or Quiz flow. Typography should pair a modern serif like Canela or Editorial New for headings with a clean sans-serif like Inter or Suisse Int’l for body. Use large whitespace, custom cursor interactions, hover animations, modals for quick add and zoom, and a sticky floating cart button for mobile-first usability. Every element should communicate refinement, intentionality, and storytelling — this is an eCommerce site that sells an aesthetic as much as it sells products.
